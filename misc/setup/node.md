		Thanks for using nestjs-pino!

		As you may know there is a war against Ukraine:
		bombed cities (including schools, hospitals, etc), hundreds of killed children, millions of refugees.
		So if you enjoy this library you can thank the author by donating to one of this funds:
		â€¢ https://war.ukraine.ua/donate/ â€“ Armed Forces of Ukraine
		â€¢ https://www.comebackalive.in.ua/ â€“ Ukrainian volunteers

		Thanks for your support! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦
